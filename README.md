# CSS Burger

When I was an instructor at [Hackingtons](https://www.hackingtons.com/) (which offers extracurricular coding classes for children), we would challenge our CSS students to "draw" a burger (or other food item) using only styled `<div>` elements.

This is my own take on the project which I created to demonstrate what's possible without using any images.
